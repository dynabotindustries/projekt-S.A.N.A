# Projekt S.A.N.A. - Chatbot

**Projekt S.A.N.A.** is a privacy-first, AI-powered chatbot designed not only for personal use but also as a versatile tool that can be deployed in business environments at scale. Built with an emphasis on **secure**, **autonomous**, and **non-intrusive** operation, **S.A.N.A.** can be integrated into various enterprise systems to assist employees, automate tasks, and support decision-making processes.

Unlike many consumer-focused products that collect large amounts of personal data, **Projekt S.A.N.A.** prioritizes user privacy. It can be deployed in environments where sensitive information is handled, ensuring that all processing occurs securely within the organization. In cases where the system is unable to process queries internally, it safely routes requests to Wolfram Alpha, a service that aligns with **privacy-conscious** principles and does not collect unnecessary user data.

Incorporating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into your internal systems, **S.A.N.A.** enables large-scale natural language processing, ensuring efficient, secure, and scalable operations for businesses. If the LLM fails to provide an answer or requires external validation, queries are directed to **Wolfram Alpha** for additional computation, ensuring privacy is maintained throughout the process.

**S.A.N.A.** is **GNU GPL 3.0** licensed, encouraging customization and contribution from the open-source community.

## Features

### 1. **Enterprise-Ready Deployment**
   - Can be deployed on company servers for internal usage.
   - Facilitates **secure and autonomous** processing of tasks, reducing reliance on external services.
   - When integrated with an **LLM**, queries are handled entirely within the company infrastructure.
   - If an LLM fails to process a query, **Wolfram Alpha** is used as a fallback for additional computational support without compromising privacy.

### 2. **Chat Interface**
   - **Text-Based Communication**: Users can type queries or commands directly into the chat interface.
   - **Voice Interaction**: The chatbot can listen to user speech and respond audibly, allowing hands-free interaction.
   - **Chat History**: All conversations are logged and can be accessed for auditing or future reference.

### 3. **Hands-Free Mode**
   - Allows continuous voice interaction, ideal for hands-free environments where users can interact without needing to type.

### 4. **Voice Customization**
   - Users can choose between male and female voices for text-to-speech responses.

### 5. **Command Handling**
   - Supports commands such as:
     - **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieve information from Wikipedia.
     - **Wolfram Alpha Queries**: Perform advanced calculations and factual queries.
     - **WhatsApp Messaging**: Send WhatsApp messages programmatically using **pywhatkit**.
     - **YouTube Playback**: Search and play YouTube videos.
     - **System Control**: Automate system-level tasks like closing tabs.

### 6. **Text-to-Speech**
   - Responses are read aloud using **pyttsx3** for a more engaging user experience.

### 7. **Error Handling**
   - If a query cannot be processed, the assistant provides clear error messages or uses external services (like Wolfram Alpha) to resolve issues.

## Privacy-First Design

**S.A.N.A.** ensures that all processing is done locally within the company environment. By using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** deployed on internal servers, sensitive information is never sent to third-party services unless necessary. In the case that the LLM is unable to process a query, the assistant routes the query to **Wolfram Alpha**, a computational knowledge engine that adheres to strict privacy standards and does not collect user data.

This architecture makes **Projekt S.A.N.A.** an ideal solution for businesses that require robust AI capabilities without sacrificing privacy or autonomy. It ensures that:
- All queries are processed internally whenever possible.
- Sensitive data is not stored or shared with third-party platforms.
- Any external requests (like Wolfram Alpha) respect the companyâ€™s privacy policies.

### Key Benefits:
- **Data Sovereignty**: Businesses retain full control over their data processing.
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Integration with privacy-respecting services ensures no unnecessary data is collected.
- **Scalability**: The solution can be scaled across large teams or departments, with robust LLM integration.
- **Customization**: The open-source nature of the project allows for full customization to meet specific business requirements.

## License

**Projekt S.A.N.A.** is licensed under the **GNU GPL 3.0** License. This allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software, while ensuring that any derivative works are also made available under the same terms.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced LLM Integration**: Future versions can incorporate more powerful or specialized LLMs for tailored enterprise solutions.
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Implement support for enterprise-level authentication systems for user management.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Extend compatibility to other platforms and operating systems for broader deployment.
- **Task Automation**: Integration with business tools like project management systems, CRMs, and databases to automate workflows.

### Example of Interaction:
Here is an example of how **Projekt S.A.N.A.** might be used in a business setting:

**User**: `search Python programming`  
**S.A.N.A**: *"Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is widely used for web development, automation, data science, and more."*

**User**: `whatsapp(1234567890, 'Report: The server upgrade is complete.')`  
**S.A.N.A**: *"Message sent to 1234567890."*

**User**: `What is the square root of 256?`  
**S.A.N.A**: *"The square root of 256 is 16."*
